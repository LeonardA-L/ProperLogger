# ProperLogger
An alternative console for Unity engine.
Propper Logger is here to help you speed up your game development in Unity with its improved console, featuring advanced search features, readability improvements, customizable layout, in-game console, and many more. 

 We tried to stay close to the Unity Editor look and feel, and build customization and features on top of that. Propper Logger comes with all the features of the vanilla Unity console, and more, including:

* Log Categorization for easier filtering
* Improved readability with dedicated icons and colors, customizable layout
* Advanced regex search and filters, like the ability to filter by context object name
* `[HideInCallstack]` attribute to clear your stacks from clutter
* Multi-selection of logs

## Comes with an in-game console

Why not get in built games the exact same enriched experience that you get in the editor?
